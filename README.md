# CSCI-499_LMs-in-NLP_USC
This repository contains my solutions and work for the **CSCI-499** course on **LMS in NLP** at USC. The course focuses on applying **machine learning** techniques to natural language processing tasks. Throughout the assignments, I will explore various algorithms, architectures, and tools for processing and understanding human language, with a particular focus on language models and other NLP techniques.

## Assignments
This repository will include solutions to assignments covering topics such as:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and text cleaning.
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, and other methods for representing words as vectors.
- **Sequence Models**: RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis.
- **Transformer Models**: Introduction to modern transformer-based architectures like BERT, GPT, etc.
- **Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate NLP models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Fine-tuning LLMs**: Final project invovled fine-tuning BART, T5, LLaMA-2 7b, Mistral 7b, and LLaMA-3 8b to generate FAQs based on any website's content.
